A crucial part of mastering digital tools is understanding the basics of \outl{programming}.
Programming is about giving instructions to a computer. In this manner, computers can perform calculations, produce images, animations, games, and much more. To give instructions, we use different \outl{programming languages}, and there's a myriad of languages to choose from. In Norwegian schools, the most commonly used languages are \net{https://scratch.mit.edu/}{Scratch}, \net{https://www.python.org/}{Python}, and \net{https://www.javascript.com/}{JavaScript}\footnote{Admittedly in a block-based version when coding with \net{https://microbit.org/}{micro:bit}.}. There's a vast array of free resources for learning programming languages, including:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \net{https://code.org/}{code.org} (general coding)
	\item \net{https://www.w3schools.com/}{w3schools.com} (general coding)
	\item \net{https://scratch.mit.edu/}{scratch.mit.edu} (Scratch)
	\item \net{https://microbit.org/}{microbit.org} (coding with micro:bit)
	\item \net{https://espensklasserom.com/}{espensklasserom.co} (Coding in Scratch, micro:bit, etc.)
	\item \net{https://www.kidsakoder.no/}{kidsakoder.no} (coding in Scratch, micro:bit, Python, etc.)
\end{itemize} \vsk

\st{Have you already reached a high level as a programmer and feel confident with data types, functions, classes, etc.? Then, the language \net{https://www.rust-lang.org/}{Rust} is recommended. Many consider this to be the successor to C++ and similar languages.}
