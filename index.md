## License and usage
The books are licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0. This means you are free to download and edit the files for non-profit purposes. The only software required for editing the books is [LaTex](https://www.latex-project.org/) and at TeX-editor.

When you have made your own edition of a book, please do not change the main title, but change the subtitle in a fitting way.
Example: If a school named Plato's Acadamy edits 'First Principle of Math' for it's own purposes, they should substitute the subtitle 'Sindre Sogge Heggen's edition' with 'Plato's Acadamy's' edition. Also, the school should inform OpenMathBooks that
a new edition has been made.
