\vedlegg{The Tangent Line to a Graph} \label{vdltangent}
\subsection*{Introduction}
In geometry, a \textit{tangent line to a circle} is defined as a line that intersects a circle at exactly one point (Moise, 1974). From this definition, it can be shown that
\begin{itemize}
	\item a tangent line is perpendicular to the vector formed by the center of the circle and the point of intersection
	\item any line that has an intersection point with a circle, and where the intersection point and the center of the circle form a normal vector to the line, is a tangent line to the circle.
\end{itemize}
(See \textsl{Figure \ref{sirkoggraf}a}.) \vsk

Given a differentiable function $ f(x) $. In real analysis, the \textit{tangent line to $ f $ at the point $ (a, f(a)) $} is defined as the line passing through $ (a, f(a)) $ and having a slope of $ f'(a) $ (Spivak, 1994). (See \textsl{Figure \ref{sirkoggraf}b}.)

It is quite intuitive for many that tangent lines to circles and tangent lines to graphs are closely related, but the purpose of this text is to formalize this.

\subsection*{The Center of Curvature}
Given a function $ {\vec{r}(t)=[f(t), g(t)]} $ where $ f $ and $ g $ are continuous and twice differentiable for all $ t\in\mathbb{R} $, and where $ f''(t), g''(t)\neq0 $. For $ a, h\in\mathbb{R} $ we set $ b=a-h $ and $ c=a+h $. Furthermore, we introduce the points
\nn{
	A=\vec{r}(a)\quad,\quad B= \vec{r}(b)\quad,\quad C=\vec{r}(c)
}
In addition, we introduce the notation $ k_d^{\hat{n}}(t) $, where $ \hat n $ replaced with $ n $ instances of $ ' $ denotes the $ n $-th derivative of the function $ k(t) $ at the point $ d $. \vsk

Let $ S=(S_x, S_y) $ be the center of the circumcircle of $ \triangle ABC $. In the same way that we find the \textit{derivative} at a point by letting the distance between two points on a graph approach 0, we can find the \outl{curvature} at a point by letting the distance between three points approach 0. In our case, the curvature is described by the circumcircle of $ \triangle ABC $ as $ h $ approaches 0.

\subsection*{A System of Equations for finding $\bm S $}
We have that
\alg{
	\vv{BA}&= [f_s-f_{b}, g_a-g_{b}] \br \vv{AC}&=[f_c-f_a, g_c-g_a]
}
Let $ B_m $ and $ C_m $ be the midpoints of (the secants) $ AB $ and $ AC $, respectively. Then,
\nn{
	B_m = \frac{1}{2}(A+B)\qquad,\qquad C_m = \frac{1}{2}(A+C)
}
$ [g_a-g_b,f_b-f_a] $ is a normal vector for $ \vv{BA} $, which means that the perpendicular bisector $\bm l_1 $ of $ AB $ can be parameterized as
\nn{
	{\bm l_1(p)}=B_m+[g_a-g_b,f_b-f_a] p \label{l1}
}
Similarly, the perpendicular bisector $\bm l_2 $ of $ AC $ is parameterized by
\[ {\bm l_2(q)}=C_m+[g_a-g_c,f_c-f_a] q \]
$ S $ coincides with the intersection of $\bm l_1 $ and $\bm l_2 $.
By requiring that $\bm l_1= \bm l_2 $, we obtain a linear system of equations with $ p $ and $ q $ as unknowns. Let $ q=q_s $ be the solution to this system, then we know that
\[ S=C_m+[g_a-g_c, f_c-f_a]q_s\]
Furthermore,
\[ \lim\limits_{h\to0}S=\lim\limits_{h\to0}\left(C_m+[g_a-g_c, f_c-g_a]\frac{h}{h}q_s\right)=A+[g'_a, -f'_a]\lim\limits_{h\to 0}h q_s \]
We will show that the limit $ \lim\limits_{h\to 0}h q_s $ exists, and we observe this: As $ {h\to0} $, $ \vv{AS} $ becomes parallel to the vector $ [g'_a, -f'_a] $. We have that $ \vec{r}'(a)=[f'_a, g'_a] $, and thus,
\[ \vv{AS}\cdot \vec{r}\,'(a)=0 \]
The line passing through the point $ \vec{r}(a) $, and having $ \vec{r}\,'(a) $ as the direction vector, is therefore a tangent line to the circle describing the curvature of $ \vec{r} $ at $ a $.

\subsubsection{Examination of the limit}
By solving the mentioned system of equations, we find that
\nn{
	q_s=\frac{1}{2}\frac{f_c(f_c-f_a)+f_b(f_a-f_c)+g_c(g_c-g_a)+g_b(g_a-g_c)}{f_b(g_c-g_a)+f_c(g_a-g_b)+f_a(g_b-g_c)}
}
Furthermore,
\[ \lim\limits_{h\to 0} q_s=\lim\limits_{h\to 0}\frac{h}{h}q_s=\lim\limits_{h\to 0}\frac{f_cf_a'-f_bf_a'+g_cg_a'-g_bg_a'}{f_bg_a'+f_cg_b'-2f_ag_a'} \]
Using the same procedure, we have that
\[\lim\limits_{h\to 0}q_s= \lim\limits_{h\to 0} \frac{(f_a')^2+(g_a')^2}{f_a'g_b'-f_b'g_a'} \]
Furthermore,
\[ \lim\limits_{h\to 0}h q_s= h\frac{(f_a')^2+(g_a')^2}{f_a'g_b'-f_b'g_a'-f_b'g_b'+f_b'g_b'}= \frac{(f_a')^2+(g_a')^2}{f_b''g_b'+f_b'g_b''} \]
