\section*{Important Note on Functions}
As mentioned in \mb, functions are variables that change as other variables change. In this book, writing a function $ f $ as $ f(x) $ indicates that $ f $ changes in concert with the variable $ x $. As long as it is established that $ x $ is a variable, there will therefore be no difference between $ f $ and $ f(x)$, for example, we can write
\begin{equation}\label{ff(x)}
	f=f(x)=2x	
\end{equation} 
Such a convention makes many explanations have neater expressions, but it requires us to be conscious of how parentheses are used in relation to multiplication and in relation to functions. We must consider whether a symbol stands for an independent variable or a variable that depends on another $ - $ thus a function. As \eqref{ff(x)} is formulated, $ x $ is an independent variable and $ f $ is a variable dependent on $ x $. For a constant $ a $, then
\alg{
	x(a)&=x\cdot a=ax \vn
	f(a)&=2\cdot a=2a
}
Furthermore,
\[ f-a=2x-a \]
