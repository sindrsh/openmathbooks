\section{Limits}
Suppose we start with the value 0.9, and then continuously add 9 as the last digit. Then we get the values 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, and so on. By adding 9 as the last digit in this way, \textsl{we can get as close as we wish $-$ but never exactly reach $-$ the value 1}. The process of \textsl{"getting as close as we wish $-$ but never exactly reaching $-$ a value"} will henceforth be referred to as "approaching a value." The method we just described can be seen as a method to \textsl{approach} 1. We can then say that the \outl{limit} of this method is 1.
To indicate a limit, we write \sym{$ \lim $}.\vsk

It is important to consider that we can approach a number from two sides; from the left or from the right on the number line. With a method that gives us the values 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, etc., we are approaching 1 from the left. If we create a method that gives us the values 1.1, 1.01, 1.001, etc., we are approaching 1 from the right. This is shown by marking \sym{$ + $} or \sym{$ - $} above the number we are approaching.

\info{\note}{
	\sym{$ x\to a$} covers the two cases \sym{$ x\to a^+ $} and \sym{$ x\to a^- $}. Often, these are so similar that we can treat \sym{$ x\to a $} as one case.

\info{An Extension of \sym{$ = $}}{
	The somewhat paradoxical aspect of limit values where $ x $ approaches $ a $, is that we often end up substituting $ x $ with $ a $, even though we have by definition that $ x\neq a $. For example, the equation
	\begin{equation} \label{limxto2}
		\lim_{x\to 2}(x+1)=2+1=3 
	\end{equation}
	It's worth pondering the similarities in \eqref{limxto2}. When $ x $ approaches 2, $ x $ will never be exactly 2. This means that $ {x+1} $ can never be \textsl{exactly equal} to 3. But \textsl{the closer} $ x $ is to 2, \textsl{the closer} $ {x+1} $ is to 3. In other words, $ {x+1} $ approaches 3 as $ x $ approaches 2. The equality in \eqref{limxto2} thus does not refer to an expression that is \textsl{exactly equal} to a value, but to an expression that \textsl{exactly approaches} a value. This means that limit values bring a somewhat expanded understanding of \sym{$ = $}.

\info{Visualization of Continuity}{
	Visually, we can distinguish between continuous and discontinuous functions in this way; continuous functions have connected graphs, discontinuous functions do not. A snippet of the graphs of the functions from \eksref{Example 1} on page \pageref{konteks1} looks like this:
	\fig{konteks1}
	Graphs work excellently for determining which functions we \textsl{expect} to be continuous or not, but they are never valid as proof of this.
