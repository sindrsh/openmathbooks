In \mb, we have seen how fractions are defined by a division of 1. In everyday use we use fractions to describe division of wholes.\vs

		\item The whole is 8 boxes. $ \frac{7}{8} $ of the boxes are blue. 
		\item The whole is a square. $ \frac{1}{4} $ of the square is red.
		\item The whole is 5 circles. $ \frac{3}{5} $ of the circles are black.

\subsection*{Fractions of numbers}
Say that the rectangle below has value $ 12 $. 
\fig{br2}
When we say ''$\frac{\colb{2}}{\colc{3}}$ of \colr{12}'', we intend to
\st{\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
	\item distribute \colr{12} into \colc{3} equal groups.
	\item find how much \colb{2} of these groups make up.
\end{enumerate}}
We have
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
	\item $ 12 $ distributed into 3 equal groups is $ 12:3=4 $.
	\fig{br2a}
	\item 2 groups with value 4 make up $ 2\cdot4=8 $.
	\fig{br2b}
\end{enumerate}
Hence
\[ \frac{2}{3}\text{ av } 12= 8 \]
\newpage
To find $ \frac{2}{3} $ of 12, we divided 12 by 3, and multiplied the quotient by 2. This is the same as multiplying $ 12 $ with $ \frac{2}{3} $ (see \mb).\regv

Fractions are excellent to describe shares because they quickly give an impression of the size. It is for example easy to see (approximately) how much $ \frac{3}{5} $ or $ \frac{7}{12} $ make up of a cake. However, sometimes it is preferable to quickly determine what share makes up the \textsl{most}, and that is easiest to decide if the fractions have the same denominator.}

What percentage does 15 make up of 20?\vsk

15 equals $ \frac{15}{20} $ of 20, so the answer to the question becomes apparent if we expand $ \frac{15}{20} $ to a fraction with denominator 100. Since $ 20\cdot\frac{100}{20}=100 $, we expand our fraction with $ \frac{100}{20}=5 $:
\alg{
\frac{15\cdot5}{20\cdot 5}= \frac{75}{100}

So, 15 makes up 75\% of 20. We could have got 75 directly writing

\subsection{Percentage change; increase or reduction \label{Proendring}}
\subsubsection{Increase} \label{prookning}
The phrase ''200 increased by 30\%'' implies the following:
\st{
200 added with 30\% av 200.
}
Therefore
\algv{
\text{200 increased with 30\%} &=200+200\cdot 30\% \\
&=200+60 \\
&= 260
}
We note that 200 is present in both our terms in the above equation, so, according to the distributive law\footnote{See \mb.},
\alg{
\text{200 increased by 30\%}&=200+200\cdot30\% \\
&= 200\cdot(1+30\%) \\
&= 200\cdot(100\%+30\%) \\
&=200\cdot 130\% 
}
Consequently,
\[ \text{200 økt med 30\% = 130\% av 200} \] 
\newpage
\subsubsection{Reduction} \label{proredusering}
The phrase ''Reduce 200 by 60\%'' implies the following:
\st{60\% of 200 subtracted from 200}
Thus
\algv{
\text{200 reduced by 60\%} &= 200-200\cdot 60\% \\
&= 200-120 \\
&= 80
}
Here as well we notice the presence of 200 in both terms:
\alg{
\text{200 reduced by 30\%} &= 200-200\cdot60\% \\
&= 200\cdot(1-60\%) \\
&= 200\cdot 40\%
}
Hence
\[ \text{200 reduced by 60\%}= \text{40\% of 200} \]

\subsection{Change factor}

\subsubsection{Finding the percentage change}
When seeking to determine a percentage change, it is important to remember it is about a percentage \textsl{of a whole}, which is the reference for the calculations. This whole is the original value. \vsk

Let us as an example say that Jakob earned 10\,000\enh{kr} in 2019, and 12\,000\enh{kr} in 2020. Then we can raise the question ''What was the percentage change of Jakob's salary from 2019 to 2020?''. \vsk

The question refer to the salary from 2019, which means that 10\,000 is our original value. Two ways of finding the percentage change of salary are whe following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Jakob's salary changed from 10\,000 to 12\,000, a change of $12\,000-10\,000= 2\,000 $. Moreover, (see \rref{proaavb})
\alg{
\text{the percentage 2\,000 makes up of 10\,000}&=2\,000\cdot\frac{100}{10\,000} \\
&=20
}
Thus, from 2019 to 2020 Jakob's salary increased by 20\%. 
\item 
We have
\alg{
\frac{12\,000}{10\,000}=1,2
}
Hence, from 2019 to 2020 the change factor of Jakob's was 1,2 (see \rref{vekstfaktendr}). This change factor corresponds to a 20\% increase (see \rref{vekstfaktordef}), which means his salary increased by 20\% during the period.
\end{itemize}

\[ \text{percantage change}=\frac{\text{changed original value}-\text{original value}}{\text{original value}}\cdot100 \]

\info{Comment}{
The looks of \rref{proendra} can be a bit intimidating, and is not necessarily easy to remember. However, if you have reached a deep understanding of the topics covered in \refdsec{Proendring}, you already know how to find a percentage change through a step by step approach without using  \rref{proendra}. In the following examples we will show both a step by step approach, and the use of \rref{proendra}.}

In 2019, a football team had 20 players. I 2020 the team had 12 players. What percentage of players in 2019 had quit in 2020?

\sv	

Firstly, we note that it is the number of players in 2019 that is our original value.\vsk

\metode{Method 1; step by step approach}{0.6\linewidth} \os
The football team went from 20 to 12 players, so $ {20-12=8} $ players quit. We have
\[ \text{the percentage 4 makes up of 20}=8\cdot\frac{100}{20}=40 \]
Hence, 40\% of the players from 2019 had quit in 2020. \vsk \vsk

\metode{Method 2; using \rref{proendra}}{0.6\linewidth} \os
We have
\alg{
\text{percentage change}&=\frac{12-20}{20}\cdot100\br
&=-\frac{8}{20}\cdot 100 \br

Hence, 40\% of the players from 2019 had quit in 2020. \vsk

\mers{Players quitting involves  a \textsl{reduction} in number of players. Therefore, we expected the percentage change to be a negative number.}

\textsl{Why can't we say that the discount increased by 50\%?}\vsk

Say that the original price of the sunglasses were 1\,000\enh{kr}.
30\% discount of 1\,000\enh{kr} yields a cut price of 300\enh{kr}. 80\% discount of 1000\enh{kr} yields a cut price of 800\enh{kr}. However, if we increase 300 by 50\%, we get $ {300\cdot1.5=450} $, which is not equal to 800. The reason for this disagreement is that we have two different references:\regv

\st{''The discount was first 30\%, and then it increased by 50 percentage points. Then the discount was 80\%.'' \vsk

\textit{Explanation:} 'The discount' is a quantity we calculate with the original price as reference. When we say ''percentage point'', we imply that \textbf{the original price is still the reference} in calculations. When the price is 1\,000\enh{kr}, we start with a discount of $ {1\,000\enh{kr}\cdot0.3=300\enh{kr}} $. When we add 50 \textsl{percentage points} to the discount, we cut off an additional 50\% of the original price, that is $ {1\,000\enh{kr}\cdot0.5=500\enh{kr}} $. In total that is a cut price of 800\enh{kr}, which makes up $ 80\% $ of the original price.
} \regv

\st{''The discount was first 30\%, and then it increased by 50\%. Then the discount was 45\%.''\vsk

\textit{Explanation:} 'The discount'' is a quantity we calculate with the original price as a reference, but when calculating the increased discount, \textbf{the original discount is the reference}. Since the original price is 1\,000\enh{kr}, we start with a discount of 300\enh{kr}. Moreover,
\[ 300\enh{kr} \text{ increased by } 50\%=300\enh{kr}\cdot1,5=450\enh{kr} \]
and
\[ \text{the percentage 450 makes up of 1\,000}=\frac{450}{100}=45 \]
Hence, the new discount is 45\%.

In the two (yellow) foregoing textboxes, we calculated the increased discounts using the original price of the sunglasses (1\,000\enh{kr}). In general, this is not necessary:

	Since the annual reduction is 12\%, the change factor is 0.88. The original value is 300\,000, and the number of changes is 4:

\subsection{Scale}
In \mb, we have studied similar triangles. The fact that the ratio of corresponding sides are equal are also valid for a lot of shapes, such as squares, circles, prisms, spheres etc. From this it follows that small drawings (models) can give us information about real-sized quantities. The number that holds this information is called the \outl{scale}.\regv

In a drawing of a house, a wall is 6\enh{cm}. The real size of the wall is 12\enh{m}. \os 

What is the scale of the drawing?

\sv
First we must ensure that the lengts have the same unit\footnote{See \refsec{regnmforbenvn}.}. We convert 12\enh{m} into an amount of 'cm':
\[ 12\enh{m}=1200\enh{cm} \]
Now
\algv{
\text{scale}&=\frac{6\enh{cm}}{12\enh{cm}} \br
&= \frac{6}{12}

Also, we should reduce the fraction
\[ \text{scale}=\frac{1}{6} \]

\info{Tip}{
The scale of a map is almost always given as a fraction with numerator $ 1 $. In that case one can make the following rules:
\begin{tcolorbox}[boxrule=0.3 mm,arc=0mm,colback=white] \alg{

\subsection{Mixing ratio}
In many situations we want to mix two (or more) to a fitting ratio. \\[3pt]

\prbxl{0.6}{ If you read the symbol ''2 + 5'' on a bottle of juice syrup, it means you are supposed to mix syrup and water to the ratio $ {2:5} $. So, if we pour 2\enh{dL} syrup in a can, we must add 5\enh{dL} water in order to make the juice with the correct mixing ratio.}\qquad
\prbxr{0.3}{If you mix juice syrup with water, you get juice :-)}
\vsk

Sometimes we don't care \textsl{how much} we are mixing, as long as the mixing ratio is correct. For example, we can mix two full buckets of juice syrup with five full buckets of water, knowing that our mixing ratio is correct, even if we don't know the volume of the bucket. When we only care about the mixing ratio, we use the term \outl{part}. Then we read ''2 + 5'' on the bottle of juice syrup as ''2 parts of syrup to 5 parts of water''. Hence, the juice includes $ {2+5}=7 $ parts:\vspace{3pt}
\fig{forh_eng}
Consequently, 1 part makes up $ \frac{1}{7} $ of the juice, the syrup makes up $ \frac{2}{7} $ of the juice, and the water makes up $ \frac{5}{7} $ of the juice.
\newpage
\reg[Parts in a mixing ratio]{A mix with ratio $ {a:b} $ includes $ {a+b} $ parts.

		&= \frac{5\cdot21}{7}\enh{dL}\br
		&= 15\enh{dL}
	}
	\item We could solve this exercise in a similar way as that of exercise a), but it is better to note that if we have 15\enh{dL} water in a total of 21\enh{dL}, then we have $ (21-15)\enh{dL}=6\enh{dL} $ syrup.

	The fraction we seek, $ \frac{1}{4} $, can be written as a fraction with the same numerator the original ratio (that is $ \frac{3}{5} $):
	\[ \frac{1}{4}=\frac{1\cdot3}{4\cdot3}=\frac{3}{12} \]
	In the original ratio there are 3 parts syrup and 5 parts water. If this is to be changed into 3 parts syrup and 12 parts water, we must add 7 parts water.
